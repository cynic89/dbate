  <h4> India and China can pollute, Why should'nt the US?</h4>
  <p style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.35);"> By Shyam Sankaran</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.2em"> Republican Presidetial candidate, Marco Rubio, in a recent debate argued that
      US should stop investing on clean energy because India and China are going to pollute the environment anyway.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.2em"> When quizzed about the rising ocean levels in Florida, his home state,
      the Senator said "The government is trying to pass some laws which are expensive, but will have zero impact on our
      environment because countries like China and India are
      going to pollute at historic levels". He was particularly critical about President Obama's clean power act,
      saying that it was forced upon the working middle class people and small scale entrepreneurs, who are struggling
      economically.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.2em"> This comes just days after Leonardo Di Caprio had dedicated almost the entirety of
       his Oscar acceptance speech to the cause of clean energy, and the dark reality of climate change,
        which perhaps explains the polarization of the right and the left
      even in matters of science.
      <p>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em"> The rationale of wanting to spend billions of dollars on the already strongest
           Military, but failing to recognize climate change as a threat to our society yet, continues to amaze me,
           and a number of other people, who think common sense is, perhaps
          common.</p>
